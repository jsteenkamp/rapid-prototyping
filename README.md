# Rapid Prototyping

See it running at [https://rapid.jsx.nz/](https://rapid.jsx.nz/)

## Getting Started

Install dependencies. You must have Node.js and npm and optionally yarn installed on your system.

`yarn install` or `npm install`

Run the development server which outputs on `http://localhost:3000`

`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

The output rebuilds automatically as you make changes.
 
Add you markdown text and code in `pages/scratch.md`

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is for building [React](https://reactjs.org/) universal apps, apps with server-side rendering included.

Next is static and server-side application framework for React. It is more flexible and easier to use existing React patterns and libraries. You have to do more things yourself, like specifying resources to pre-fetch and lazy-load. 

## CSS-in-JS

* [Using styled-components with Next.js](https://jsramblings.com/2017/11/27/using-styled-components-with-next-js.html) shows how to configure babel correctly so you do not get checksum mismatches due to different class generation on the client and on the server. 
* [Theme Provider](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/4170) this works in [Next.js 6](https://zeit.co/blog/next6).
* [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) and 
* [system-components](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/tree/master/system-components) work fine.

## Deployment

Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to generate static output in the `out` directory. You can upload this directory to your host.

I use [Now](https://zeit.co/now). Other options include [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Surge](https://surge.sh/).
